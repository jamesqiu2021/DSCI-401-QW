## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

This is cool! Great!
```{r}
x <- rnorm(15)
hist(x)
```
```{r}
 "Hello World!"
```
```{r}
height <- 442
height
#Comments You are good!
height <- 442 
height <- "really tall"
```

```{r}
class(height)
```


```{r}
x <- 1
while (x <= 100)
  {x <- x + 1
  print(x)}
cat("Last x is", x)
```
```{r}
cat("Last x is", x)
print(paste0("Last x is ",x))
```
```{r}
x <- 1
while (x < 5){
  print("Hello")
  x <- x*2
}
```

```{r}
for (i in 1:10){
  print(i)
}
```
```{r}
for (i in 10:1){
  print(i)
}
```
```{r}
for (i in c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11)){
  print(i)
}
```
