## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(mdsr)
```

```{r}
Teams <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gjm112/DSCI401/main/data/Teams.csv")
```

# 1 (a) Create a data frame that is a subset of the Teams data frame that contains only the years from 2000 through 2009 and the variables yearID, W, and L.

```{r}
Myteams <- filter(Teams, yearID==(2000:2009)) 
Myteams [c("yearID","W","L")]
```

# 1 (b) How many years did the Chicago Cubs (teamID is \CHN") hit at least 200 HRs in a season and what was the median number of wins in those seasons.

```{r}
Cubs <- Teams %>% filter(teamID == "CHN") %>% filter(HR >= 200) %>% group_by(HR)   
Cubs
```

```{r}
nrow(Cubs)
```

```{r}
Cubs <- Teams %>% filter(teamID == "CHN") %>% filter(HR >= 200) %>% group_by(HR) %>% summarize(mn_wins = mean(W))
Cubs
mean(Cubs$mn_wins)
```

#1(c) Create a factor called election that divides the yearID into 4-year blocks that correspond to U.S. presidential terms. The first presidential term started in 1788. They each last 4 years and are still on the schedule set in 1788. During which term have the most home runs been hit?

1)  create a factor name election
2)  divide yearID into 4-year blocks that correspond to U.S. presidential terms, that started in 1788
3)  determine during which term have the most home runs been hit

```{r}
yearBreaks <- seq(1788,2021, by = 4)
Myteams <-Teams %>% 
mutate(election = cut(yearID, breaks = yearBreaks)) %>% 
group_by(election) %>% 
summarise(THR = sum(HR)) %>% 
arrange (desc(THR))
Myteams
```

# 1(d) Make a line plot of total home runs per season and stratify by league. Remove observations where league is missing.

```{r}
 Teams$lgID<-as.character(Teams$lgID)
THRteams <-Teams %>% 
  drop_na(lgID) %>%  
  select(lgID,HR) %>%  
  group_by (lgID) %>% 
  summarize (THR = sum(HR)) %>% 
  arrange (desc(THR)) 
THRteams
```

```{r}
Teams$lgID<-as.character(Teams$lgID)
THRteams <-Teams %>% 
  drop_na(lgID) %>%  
  select(lgID,yearID,HR) %>%  
  group_by (lgID,yearID) %>% 
  summarize (THR = sum(HR)) %>% 
  arrange (desc(THR)) 
THRteams
```

```{r}
g <- ggplot(data = THRteams, aes(x = yearID, y = THR)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = lgID)) + geom_smooth(aes(color = lgID), method = "lm", se = FALSE) + facet_wrap(~ lgID)
g
```

# 1(e) Create an indicator variable called winning_record" which is defined as TRUE if the number of wins is greater than the number of losses and FALSE otherwise. Plot a scatter plot of Runs (R) vs Runs against (RA) with the color of each point showing whether that team had a winning record or not.

```{r}
WRteams <- Teams %>% 
  mutate (Winning_record = ifelse(W>L,"TRUE", "FALSE"))
```

```{r}
g <- ggplot(data = WRteams, aes(x = R, y = RA)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = Winning_record)) + xlab("Runs") +
  ylab("Runs against") 
g

```

# 2(a) What month had the highest proportion of cancelled fights? What month had the lowest? Interpret any seasonal patterns.

```{r}
library (nycflights13)
myflights <- flights %>% 
  filter (is.na(dep_time)) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarize (highest_cancelled = max(sum(is.na(dep_time))))%>% 
  arrange (desc(highest_cancelled))
myflights
```

# Feb. had the hightest cancelled flights and Nov. had the lowest cancelled flights. Winter (Dec-Feb) had the most canelled flights and fall (Aug-Nov) had the least cancelled flights.

# 2(b) Given that a delay is longer than an hour, what is the average time of the total delay by airport (i.e. origin)

```{r}
flights %>% filter (arr_delay > 60) %>% group_by(origin) %>% summarize (average_time_delay = mean (arr_delay))
```

# 2(c) What is the average air time for all fights by carrier? Which carrier has the longest average air time on their fights?

```{r}
flights %>% drop_na (air_time) %>%  group_by(carrier) %>% summarise(average_air_time = mean (air_time)) %>% arrange(desc(average_air_time))
```

# 2(d) Keeping only fights that had a delay greater than 0, create a histogram for each month of the delay data.

```{r}
flights %>% filter (arr_delay > 0) 
ggplot(data = flights,aes(x = month),y = arr_delay) + geom_histogram()
```

# 2(e) Create side-by-side boxplots of delay times for fights with delays 60 minutes or greater for the top

```{r}
flights %>% filter (arr_delay >= 60) 
g <- ggplot(flights, aes(x=origin, y=arr_delay)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
g

```
